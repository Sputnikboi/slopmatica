# Slopmatica Cloud

A small self-hosted service that stores schematics (`.slopmatic`, vanilla `.nbt`, `.litematic`) per Minecraft account,
for the Slopmatica mod's cloud autosync, plus a website for browsing, uploading,
renaming, deleting and converting them.

There are no passwords. The game proves who the player is the same way a Minecraft
server does it (Mojang `join` / `hasJoined`), and the game also hands out one-time
links for logging in to the website.

FastAPI + uvicorn, SQLite (metadata only), files on disk, server-rendered HTML plus a
little vanilla JS. No build step, no CDN.

## Run

```bash
cd ~/Git/stencil/cloud
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/uvicorn slopmatica_cloud.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8095
.venv/bin/pytest            # tests (Mojang is faked locally)
```

`slopmatica-cloud.service` is a systemd **user** unit for the same command. It is not
installed. To install it:
`ln -s ~/Git/stencil/cloud/slopmatica-cloud.service ~/.config/systemd/user/ && systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now slopmatica-cloud`.
It reads optional overrides from `~/.config/slopmatica-cloud/env`.

## Configuration (env vars)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SLOPMATICA_DATA` | `cloud/data` | Data directory: `cloud.db` plus `users/<uuid>/files/...` and `users/<uuid>/thumbs/<path>.png` |
| `SLOPMATICA_ROOT_PATH` | *(empty)* | URL prefix when mounted under a path, e.g. `/slopmatica`. Works whether or not the proxy strips the prefix. |
| `SLOPMATICA_ADMINS` | `sputnikboi` | Comma-separated Minecraft names with unlimited storage. Names are matched case-insensitively at login, and the account's uuid then stays an admin even after a rename. |
| `SLOPMATICA_QUOTA_BYTES` | `1073741824` | Per-account quota (1 GiB) |
| `SLOPMATICA_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8095` | External origin used to build web-login links (`<PUBLIC_URL><ROOT_PATH>/login/<token>`). If it is `https://`, session cookies are marked Secure. |
| `SLOPMATICA_MOJANG_HASJOINED` | `https://sessionserver.mojang.com/session/minecraft/hasJoined` | Override for tests |

## API

All errors look like `{"error": "..."}`. All paths below are relative to `ROOT_PATH`.

### Auth

1. `POST /api/auth/challenge` returns `{"serverId": "<40 hex>"}`. It is valid for 2 minutes and can be used once.
2. The mod calls Mojang's `join` with that serverId.
3. `POST /api/auth/verify` with `{"username", "serverId"}` returns
   `{"token", "uuid", "name", "usedBytes", "quotaBytes"}` (`quotaBytes: null` means unlimited).
   The token lasts 180 days. On failure you get 401. A malformed body or username gets 400.
4. Every other API call sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. A missing, invalid or expired token gets 401.

`POST /api/weblogin` (bearer only) returns `{"url": ".../login/<token>"}`. The link is
single use and valid for 5 minutes. Opening it sets an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax session cookie
that lasts 30 days, then redirects to the site root. `POST /logout` ends the session.

The website uses the same API with the cookie. Requests that change something (PUT, POST
or DELETE) and authenticate by cookie must send `X-Requested-With: slopmatica`; without it
they get 403. Bearer requests don't need the header.

### Files

Paths are `/`-separated and relative to the account's space. They must end in `.slopmatic`,
`.nbt` or `.litematic` and may use at most 8 segments, 100 characters per segment and 300 characters in total.
These are rejected with 400: empty segments, segments starting with `.`, backslashes,
control characters, `<>:"|?*`, segments with leading or trailing whitespace or a trailing
`.`, and folder names ending in one of those extensions.

| Method & path | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/me` | `{"uuid","name","usedBytes","quotaBytes"}` |
| `GET /api/files` | `{"files":[{"path","size","sha256","modified"(unix ms),"hasThumbnail"}],"usedBytes","quotaBytes"}` |
| `PUT /api/files/{path}` | Raw body. It must be gzip (`1f 8b`) and at most 256 MiB. Optional `X-Sha256` must match. Returns 201 (new) or 200 (replaced) with the file entry. Over quota gives 413 `{"error":"quota exceeded","usedBytes","quotaBytes"}`; the quota counts the new size minus the size of the file being replaced. Replacing a file with different bytes drops its (now stale) thumbnail. |
| `GET /api/files/{path}` | Bytes, `application/octet-stream`, `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Sha256` |
| `GET /api/export/{path}?format=slopmatic\|nbt\|litematic` | The file converted to another format: bytes, `application/octet-stream`, `Content-Disposition: attachment` named like the original with the new extension (no folder). 400 for a missing, unknown or same format, for a file that cannot be parsed, or for more than 64 million blocks of volume. 404 if the file is missing. A read, so cookie requests need no `X-Requested-With`. |
| `DELETE /api/files/{path}` | 204. The thumbnail is deleted too. |
| `POST /api/files/move` | `{"from","to"}` returns 200 with the new entry. The thumbnail moves along. 404 if the source is missing, 409 if the target exists. |
| `PUT /api/thumbnails/{path}` | Raw PNG, at most 2 MiB, for an existing file (404 otherwise). Returns 200 with the file entry. Thumbnails don't count toward the quota. |
| `GET /api/thumbnails/{path}` | `image/png` or 404 |

### Export (format conversion)

`slopmatica_cloud/convert.py` converts between the three formats through one in-memory model
(regions with a palette and an index per block, block entities, entities), using the small
NBT reader/writer in `slopmatica_cloud/nbt.py`. Block state compounds and the data version
are copied unchanged, so Minecraft's data fixers see the output as they would have seen
the input. Entity and block entity NBT is passed through apart from its coordinates.

- Several Litematica regions become one `.nbt` box over their enclosing bounds. Where regions
  overlap, a real block beats air and structure void, and air beats structure void.
  Otherwise the later region wins, except that a structure void never overwrites anything.
- In `.nbt`, positions missing from `blocks` are structure voids. They become a
  `minecraft:structure_void` palette entry in the other formats, and are left out again on
  the way back. Air is listed.
- `.nbt` has no name, so the file name is used.
- Two conversions run at once (`Settings.export_slots`). Other requests wait up to 30 s, then
  get 503. The conversion is pure Python. At the 64-million-block cap, a `.litematic`
  takes about 7 s to read. Worst case, writing a fully listed `.nbt` takes about 40 s.
  A `.nbt` input is also limited to 8 million NBT tags, about 1.3 million listed blocks,
  because each tag is a Python object.

Disk is the source of truth for bytes. At startup the SQLite metadata is reconciled with
what is under `users/<uuid>/files/`.
