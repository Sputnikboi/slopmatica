# Slopmatica Cloud

A small self-hosted service that stores `.litematic` schematics per Minecraft account,
for the Slopmatica mod's cloud autosync, plus a website for browsing, uploading,
renaming and deleting them.

There are no passwords. The game proves who the player is the same way a Minecraft
server does it (Mojang `join` / `hasJoined`), and the game also hands out one-time
links for logging in to the website.

FastAPI + uvicorn, SQLite (metadata only), files on disk, server-rendered HTML plus a
little vanilla JS. No build step, no CDN.

## Run

```bash
cd ~/Git/stencil/cloud
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/uvicorn slopmatica_cloud.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8095
.venv/bin/pytest            # tests (Mojang is faked locally)
```

`slopmatica-cloud.service` is a systemd **user** unit for the same command. It is not
installed. To install it:
`ln -s ~/Git/stencil/cloud/slopmatica-cloud.service ~/.config/systemd/user/ && systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now slopmatica-cloud`.
It reads optional overrides from `~/.config/slopmatica-cloud/env`.

## Configuration (env vars)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SLOPMATICA_DATA` | `cloud/data` | Data directory: `cloud.db` plus `users/<uuid>/files/...` and `users/<uuid>/thumbs/<path>.png` |
| `SLOPMATICA_ROOT_PATH` | *(empty)* | URL prefix when mounted under a path, e.g. `/slopmatica`. Works whether or not the proxy strips the prefix. |
| `SLOPMATICA_ADMINS` | `sputnikboi` | Comma-separated Minecraft names with unlimited storage. Names are matched case-insensitively at login, and the account's uuid then stays an admin even after a rename. |
| `SLOPMATICA_QUOTA_BYTES` | `1073741824` | Per-account quota (1 GiB) |
| `SLOPMATICA_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8095` | External origin used to build web-login links (`<PUBLIC_URL><ROOT_PATH>/login/<token>`). If it is `https://`, session cookies are marked Secure. |
| `SLOPMATICA_MOJANG_HASJOINED` | `https://sessionserver.mojang.com/session/minecraft/hasJoined` | Override for tests |

## API

All errors look like `{"error": "..."}`. All paths below are relative to `ROOT_PATH`.

### Auth

1. `POST /api/auth/challenge` returns `{"serverId": "<40 hex>"}`. It is valid for 2 minutes and can be used once.
2. The mod calls Mojang's `join` with that serverId.
3. `POST /api/auth/verify` with `{"username", "serverId"}` returns
   `{"token", "uuid", "name", "usedBytes", "quotaBytes"}` (`quotaBytes: null` means unlimited).
   The token lasts 180 days. On failure you get 401. A malformed body or username gets 400.
4. Every other API call sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. A missing, invalid or expired token gets 401.

`POST /api/weblogin` (bearer only) returns `{"url": ".../login/<token>"}`. The link is
single use and valid for 5 minutes. Opening it sets an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax session cookie
that lasts 30 days, then redirects to the site root. `POST /logout` ends the session.

The website uses the same API with the cookie. Requests that change something (PUT, POST
or DELETE) and authenticate by cookie must send `X-Requested-With: slopmatica`; without it
they get 403. Bearer requests don't need the header.

### Files

Paths are `/`-separated and relative to the account's space. They must end in `.litematic`
and may use at most 8 segments, 100 characters per segment and 300 characters in total.
These are rejected with 400: empty segments, segments starting with `.`, backslashes,
control characters, `<>:"|?*`, segments with leading or trailing whitespace or a trailing
`.`, and folder names ending in `.litematic`.

| Method & path | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/me` | `{"uuid","name","usedBytes","quotaBytes"}` |
| `GET /api/files` | `{"files":[{"path","size","sha256","modified"(unix ms),"hasThumbnail"}],"usedBytes","quotaBytes"}` |
| `PUT /api/files/{path}` | Raw body. It must be gzip (`1f 8b`) and at most 256 MiB. Optional `X-Sha256` must match. Returns 201 (new) or 200 (replaced) with the file entry. Over quota gives 413 `{"error":"quota exceeded","usedBytes","quotaBytes"}`; the quota counts the new size minus the size of the file being replaced. Replacing a file with different bytes drops its (now stale) thumbnail. |
| `GET /api/files/{path}` | Bytes, `application/octet-stream`, `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Sha256` |
| `DELETE /api/files/{path}` | 204. The thumbnail is deleted too. |
| `POST /api/files/move` | `{"from","to"}` returns 200 with the new entry. The thumbnail moves along. 404 if the source is missing, 409 if the target exists. |
| `PUT /api/thumbnails/{path}` | Raw PNG, at most 2 MiB, for an existing file (404 otherwise). Returns 200 with the file entry. Thumbnails don't count toward the quota. |
| `GET /api/thumbnails/{path}` | `image/png` or 404 |

Disk is the source of truth for bytes. At startup the SQLite metadata is reconciled with
what is under `users/<uuid>/files/`.
